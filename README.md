# Phonograph_piezo_pickup
An electric pickup element for your antique phonograph

A Piezo electric pickup for your phonograph allows you to record your (wax) cylinders without holding a microphone in front of the phonograph.
This device is a true pickup element that generates line-out levels that can go directly into the line-in of any audio recording device.

This project demonstrates how easy it canbe to make a piezo electric pickup element for your phonograph.
Basically all you need is a large diameter piezo speaker and a stylus.
Using some glue, 3D printed parts, aluminum tube, cotton wool and silicone caulk it can be assembled into something practical.
